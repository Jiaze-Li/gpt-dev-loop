// Per-loopId exclusive lease.
//
// Two reviewloop_review calls for the SAME loopId — two OS processes, or two
// overlapping MCP invocations in one process — must not both read the loop
// state, both run the Reviewer, both spend, and then clobber each other's
// durable state (lost update on round / reviewerCalls / findingSignatureHistory
// / the spend + reservation + information ledgers).
//
// Two layers:
//   * an in-process promise chain per loopId (serializes overlapping calls in
//     one process; the second call runs AFTER the first and then hits the
//     deterministic NO_PROGRESS guard — one dispatch, no lost update);
//   * a durable cross-process lock file `<runtimeRoot>/<loopId>/reviewloop.lock`
//     ({ token, pid, host, acquiredAt, expiresAt, renewedAt }).
//
// Reclaim rule (safety-critical): a lock is reclaimed ONLY when its owner is
// provably gone.
//   * same host  -> the owner pid no longer exists. This is authoritative and
//     the fixed TTL is IRRELEVANT here: a slow-but-alive owner (a long chunked
//     review, a 15-minute PR wait) keeps its lock past the nominal TTL.
//   * other host -> we cannot inspect the pid, so we fall back to the TTL —
//     which a live owner keeps fresh by RENEWING it on a timer (heartbeat).
//     An expired remote lock is presumed abandoned.
//   * unreadable / malformed lock record -> treated as abandoned.
//
// Renew is a compare-and-swap on the INODE, not the path: the owner keeps an
// open descriptor to the exact lock file it published at acquire time and
// writes renewals only through it (a single positional write of an equal-length
// record). If a remote contender has meanwhile reclaimed the path and linked
// its own lock, that is a different inode — the renewal lands on our unlinked
// inode and is invisible, so a renewal can never overwrite a successor lease.
// A crash mid-write can only truncate our own record, which the malformed-lock
// reclaim path already handles.
